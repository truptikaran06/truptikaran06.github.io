                <h2>Trupti Karan </h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Hi, I'm Trupti Karan, My background includes a Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from
                    Mumbai Univeristy. In terms of my work experienece, an IT professional with over 1.5 years of
                    experience in Infosys Limited India. I've gained valuable skills in programming languages such as
                    Python and Java, as well as hands-on experience with database management and web development during
                    my coursework, internships and work experience, and I'm always looking for opportunities to tackle
                    new challenges in the IT field.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and
                    management here at the Illinois institute of technology. It's a pleasure to address you all today
                    and give you a glimpse into my journey and what lies ahead.

                    Looking beyond my degree, I have clear intentions for my future. My goal is to expand my expertise
                    beyond backend development and become proficient in frontend technologies as well. This will allow
                    me to develop end-to-end solutions independently and contribute effectively to full-stack
                    development projects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Before embarking on this academic journey, I was fortunate enough to have some prior experience in
                    programming and IT. I was working in Infosys limited for 2 years in the Finacle unit as a systems
                    engineer.

                    One of my hobbies that I'm deeply passionate about is playing badminton. Engaging in this sport
                    brings me immense joy and allows me to unwind and recharge.</p>
